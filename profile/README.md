# Welcome to the IXO Foundation GitHub

## Introduction

Welcome to the IXO Foundation‚Äôs official GitHub organization! We are building the Internet of Impact, a decentralized platform that uses blockchain technology to create, verify, and exchange digital assets linked to real-world social, environmental, and economic impacts. As a Cosmos-based Layer 1 appchain, IXO enables verifiable claims and impact measurement with trusted data.

Our goal is to enable developers, organizations, and innovators to build applications that drive measurable, sustainable outcomes globally.
